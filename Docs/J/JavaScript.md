- **Remarks**: 
	JavaScript is a High Level programming language, which was originally made as a supporting language in Websites, along with HTML & CSS. It is a critical part of the World Wide Web, with around 97% of the websites in the world using this. Due to this, JavaScript has a built-in support in all browsers. Because of its popularity, it was also implemented in Backend development in the form of Node.js. 

Hello World program in JavaScript
```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This is only a single line, I know, but that's the all that is required. `console` is basically your console or terminal, depending on whether you are on Browser or Node.js. `log` basically does what is says, it `logs` (or prints) the text to the console.

If you noticed the `;` (semicolon), you might be wondering what it is for. It is basically, to let the program know that the line ends at that. So it is kinda like a full stop is for a sentence. However, it is NOT NECESSARY to have a `;` at the end of a line, since JavaScript still works, without the semicolon. But putting the semicolon is still a recommended practice.
