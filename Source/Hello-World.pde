// Processing is a programming language for creation of digital arts and multimedia
// content, allowing non-programmers to learn fundamentals of computer programming
// in a visual context.

// In Processing, the program entry point is a function named setup() with a
// void return type.

// Note! The syntax looks strikingly similar to that of C++.

void setup() {
  // This prints out the classic output "Hello World!" to the console when run.
  println("Hello, World!"); // Another language with a semi-column trap, aint it?
}
