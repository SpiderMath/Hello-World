! Fortran general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.
! It is a REALLY old language, made in 1954 [It is older than a lot of the Grandparents we have]. This file has the extension f90 because the final code standard on this was made in 1990
! This is where you declare the program kinda
program hello
	! print is to print stuff out, to the console
	print *, 'Hello, World!'

! end basically tells the code to END the program
end program hello
