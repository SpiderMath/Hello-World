// main is the Entry point of the program, so the program basically starts from here
fn main() {
	// println is a Macro so it uses ! after it. It basically prints out whatever string is passed in as the first argument
	println!("Hello, World!");
	// println moves the cursor to the next line, so the next print or println would cause the program to output in the next line
}

// Rust is a language focused on speed, security and concurrency of the program. It provides the speed of a low level programming language like C, C++ while providing High level abstractions like of those in Python and Ruby
// It thus can be a viable alternative to other languages in many ways
