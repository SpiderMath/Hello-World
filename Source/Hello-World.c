#include <stdio.h>
// Importing the stdio library, it gives us access to various methods to print stuff etc

// main() is the entry point of the program, and it will be where the main logic has to work
int main()
{
	// printf() prints the text to the console, without moving the curson to the next line
	printf("Hello, World!");
	return 0;
	// We are returning 0, since the program is declared as `int main` which means it returns an int value. By return 0, we do just that
}

// C, as with C++ is one of the fastest programming languages, and is also one of the Oldest. It is a precursor to C++, and is still used for a variety of reasons
